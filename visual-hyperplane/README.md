# Visual Hyperplane Experiments

This experiment compares KL-divergence (nonparametric) 
and a GAN-divergence for enforcing toy constraints 
(MNIST digits have to sum up to 25).

There are two steps:
- Analyzing divergence with fixed distributions.
- End-to-end generation of MNIST digits summing up to 25.
